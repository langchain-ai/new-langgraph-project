      - 'Remove the word "int" in the second call to the function.'
      - "Update the documentation to include a clear, meaningful explanation in English."

        text: "Provide a dedicated function to compute the series sum; print the sum inside that function (not in main). A separate print function for this line is unnecessary."

        text: "Use meaningful names; declare variables only at the start of a function; initialize every variable; braces on their own lines with consistent indentation; no empty clause in a for loop header; brief English docs for each function (purpose, parameters, return value); declare functions before main and implement them after main."

        topic: "Function Decomposition"
        text: "Combine similar calculations into one function when possible (e.g., square area via rectangle formula, hypotenuse via distance formula). Each calculation is implemented in its own function; no calculation is implemented directly inside main."

  - id: Exc4_cyberKioskSolution
    type: debug
    fixes:
      - "In takeOrder, add the missing ampersand (&) in the scanf that reads hasTlush."
      - "In takeOrder, read sizeChoice with %c instead of %d."
      - "In takeOrder, add getchar() to clear the buffer between reading typeChoice and sizeChoice (both are char)."
      - "In takeOrder, the call to printReceipt has the parameters swapped; switch sizeChoice and typeChoice."
      - "In printReceipt, when the customer has a voucher, add the penalty to the price instead of overwriting the total; replace shakePrice = TLUSH_PENALTY with shakePrice += TLUSH_PENALTY."

  - id: Exc5_doubleFunSolution
    type: debug
    fixes:
      - "welcome and usage do the same thing; keep only one of them."
      - "Call getNumber from main, not from usage; printing info and requesting input are unrelated."
      - "Change getNumber from while to do-while so it reads and validates input; update the documentation to state it both reads and validates the number. Doing only one of these two changes loses 2 points; doing neither loses 4."
